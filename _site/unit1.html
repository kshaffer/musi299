                  <h2 id='unit_i_january_7february_1'>Unit I (January 7–February 1)</h2>

<p>Unit I will cover the following three topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>strict voice-leading in two parts (species counterpoint)</li>

<li>rhythmic performance</li>

<li>transcription (with an emphasis on bass lines)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also included in this unit of study will be work that contributes to the semester-long <em>technology</em> topic.</p>

<p>All strict voice-leading assessments must be completed by <em>Friday, February 1</em>.</p>

<p>Final rhythmic performance assessments will take place on <em>Tuesday, February 5</em>. (Students are encouraged to assess prior to that date.)</p>

<p>All transcription work must be submitted by <em>Monday, February 5</em>.</p>

<p>Work for each topic of study will be evaluated on a four-point scale: <em>mastery</em> (4), <em>working knowledge</em> (3), <em>incomplete understanding</em> (2), <em>poor understanding</em> (1), and <em>no significant attempt made</em> (0). Rubrics for each category are provided below. (For further information on how final grades are calculated, consult the course syllabus.)</p>

<h2 id='assessment_rubrics'>Assessment rubrics</h2>

<h3 id='strict_voiceleading'>Strict voice-leading</h3>

<p>Our study of strict voice-leading follows a sequence of six stages. Each stage must be satisfactorily completed before moving to the next. The stages are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fundamentals: types of motion and consonance/dissonance</li>

<li><em>Cantus firmus</em> composition</li>

<li>First-species counterpoint (in two voices)</li>

<li>Second-species counterpoint (in two voices)</li>

<li>Third-species counterpoint (in two voices)</li>

<li>Fourth-species counterpoint (in two voices)</li>
</ul>

<p>To pass the <em>types of motion</em> stage, a student must demonstrate the ability to identify similar, parallel, contrary, and oblique motion between two voices in a score, as well as identify any interval as a perfect consonance, imperfect consonance, or dissonance (for melodic and harmonic intervals).</p>

<p>To pass the <em>cantus firmus composition</em> stage, a student must demonstrate the ability to <em>compose</em> and <em>sing</em> a cantus firmus (short, arhythmic melody) that exhibits the characteristics outlined on the <a href='http://kshaffer.github.com/musicianshipResources'>Musicianship Resources</a> website.</p>

<p>To pass each of the <em>species counterpoint</em> stages, a student must demonstrate the ability to <em>compose</em> and <em>sing</em> a counterpoint line of that species against a given cantus firmus, both in major and in minor, both above and below the cantus, that exhibits the characteristics outlined on the <a href='http://kshaffer.github.com/musicianshipResources'>Musicianship Resources</a> website. Both <em>composing</em> and <em>singing</em> activities can be done with a partner, but both individuals must convince me of their own mastery of the material.</p>

<p>Final assessments for this category will simply reflect the last species satisfactorily completed. Thus students who have not passed first species by the deadline will receive a 0, students who have passed first species will receive a 1, second species – 2, third species – 3, and fourth species – 4.</p>

<h3 id='rhythmic_performance'>Rhythmic performance</h3>

<p>The goal for this unit is for students to be able to perform a rhythm from sight, in any standard meter, with durations between the bar length and the subdivision length, with both straight and syncopated rhythms.</p>

<p>Rhythmic lines will be categorized according to the criteria listed below. Students must demonstrate the ability to perform rhythms consistently, with minimal errors, on each level before moving to the next. The most advanced level in which a student has demonstrated proficiency will be the student&#8217;s grade for this category (i.e., proficiency in levels 0–3 by the deadline will result in a grade of 3).</p>

<p>Level 0: Rhythmic lines in any standard meter (simple or compound) with durations between the division level and the bar level, with tied and dotted rhythms, no syncopation. (Most students will carry over this proficiency from Musicianship I.)</p>

<p>Level 1: Rhythmic lines with level 1 characteristics, but introducing beat-level syncopations in simple meter.</p>

<p>Level 2: Rhythmic lines with level 2 characteristics, but introducing beat-level syncopations in compound meter.</p>

<p>Level 3: Rhythmic lines with level 3 characteristics, but introducing division-level syncopations in simple meter.</p>

<p>Level 4: Rhythmic lines with level 4 characteristics, but introducing division-level syncopations in compound meter.</p>

<h3 id='transcription'>Transcription</h3>

<p>The goal for this unit is for students to be able to transcribe the bass guitar part to any pop/rock song and the vocal bass part of a choral ensemble.</p>

<p>Final grades for this category will be assigned according to the progress students have made towards this goal by the performance exam deadline, according to the following rubric.</p>

<p><em>Mastery (4)</em> – Student can transcribe a bass guitar part from a pop/rock song of a moderate or high degree of difficulty with minimal errors in pitch, rhythm, and register. Student can transcribe a vocal bass part from a recording of a choral work of a moderate degree of difficulty with minimal errors in pitch, rhythm, and register.</p>

<p><em>Working knowledge (3)</em> – Student performs up to <em>mastery</em> standard in one genre, but has some difficulty with the other.</p>

<p><em>Incomplete knowledge (2)</em> – Student demonstrates a moderate degree of difficulty with both genres.</p>

<p><em>Poor knowledge (1)</em> – Student demonstrates significant difficulties with one or both genres.</p>

<p><em>No significant attempt made (0)</em> – Student does not assess this category, or performs below the standard for passing Musicianship I.</p>

<h3 id='technology'>Technology</h3>

<p>During Unit I, student will be expected to demonstrate an ability to produce counterpoint exercises and bass-line transcriptions in a music notation application. Since this category is on-going, and will not be complete until the end of the term, no grade will be assigned at the end of Unit I.</p>
