                  <h1 id='unit_i_german_art_song_january_7february_11'>Unit I: German art song (January 7–February 11)</h1>

<p>Unit I will cover the following four topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>text-music relationships</li>

<li>harmonic syntax</li>

<li>melodic performance</li>

<li>harmonic listening</li>
</ul>

<p>Also included in this unit of study will be work that contributes to the semester-long <em>technology</em> and <em>writing about music</em> topics.</p>

<p>Assessments for the <em>text-music relationships</em> and <em>harmonic syntax</em> criteria will come from a single analysis/paper project due on Monday, February 11.</p>

<p>Final harmonic listening assessments will take place on <em>Tuesday, February 5</em>.</p>

<p>Final melodic performance assessments will take place on <em>Thursday, February 7</em>. (Students are encouraged to assess prior to that date.)</p>

<p>Work for each topic of study will be evaluated on a four-point scale: <em>mastery</em> (4), <em>working knowledge</em> (3), <em>incomplete understanding</em> (2), <em>poor understanding</em> (1), and <em>no significant attempt made</em> (0). Rubrics for each category are provided below. (For further information on how final grades are calculated, consult the course syllabus.)</p>

<h1 id='assessment_rubrics'>Assessment rubrics</h1>

<h3 id='textmusic_relationships'>Text-music relationships</h3>

<p>The following will be demonstrated in a 1000–1500 word paper due at the end of the unit. (More details on the paper forthcoming on the course website.)</p>

<p>The objectives for this topic are for each student to be able to 1) describe the tone, voice, structure, meaning, imagery, sound, etc. of a Romantic poem in German (with the assistance of an English translation); 2) describe the formal structure of the musical setting and any text-painting devices employed by the composer; 3) describe the composer&#8217;s interpretation of the poem based on his/her musical setting of it; and 4) interpret the composer&#8217;s interpretations by critically evaluating it in light of <em>your</em> interpretation of the text and other interpretive and musical possibilities available to the composer.</p>

<p>Your grade for this criterion will simply be the number of these objectives you demonstrate in your paper. If you can clearly describe the main features of the poem and music but do not interpret, you get a 2. If you also accurately describe the composer&#8217;s interpretation, you get a 3. If you can also offer a nuanced interpretation of the composer&#8217;s interpretation in light of other possibilities, you get a 4.</p>

<h3 id='harmonic_syntax'>Harmonic syntax</h3>

<p>The objective for this topic of study is to cap our study of harmonic syntax in tonal music, with each student able to perform an accurate thoroughbass reduction of a piece of music that involves diatonic and chromatic elements, modal mixture, and modulation.</p>

<p>Grades for this criterion will be assigned according to the following rubric, primarily in light of both a German art song analysis project. Harmonic analyses of dictation passages will also contribute to this assessment.</p>

<p><em>Mastery (4)</em> – Student can produce a thoroughbass reduction (bass and figures) of a German art song, with a functional bass analysis <em>and</em> a Roman numeral analysis, with all modulations labeled by type, typeset in music notation software with minimal errors.</p>

<p><em>Working knowledge (3)</em> – Same as <em>mastery</em>, but with more than minimal errors.</p>

<p><em>Incomplete knowledge (2)</em> – Student demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of one or more conceptual elements (functions, mixture, proper nomenclature, chordal roots, etc.) or makes substantial errors in analysis (such as long passages analyzed in an incorrect key) or moderate errors in reduction.</p>

<p><em>Poor knowledge (1)</em> – Student demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of multiple conceptual elements or an inability to reduce art song texture to a thoroughbass line.</p>

<p><em>No significant attempt made (0)</em> – Student does not submit a complete analysis project on time, or demonstrates knowledge below passing level for Elementary Theory II.</p>

<h3 id='melodic_performance'>Melodic performance</h3>

<p>The objective for this category is for each student to be able to sing from sight a melody in any standard key or meter that includes standard chromatic figures and/or modulates to a closely related key.</p>

<p>Melodies will be categorized according to the criteria listed below. Students must demonstrate the ability to perform melodies consistently, with minimal errors, on each level before moving to the next. The most advanced level in which a student has demonstrated proficiency will be the student&#8217;s grade for this category (i.e., proficiency in levels 0–3 by the deadline will result in a grade of 3).</p>

<p>Level 0: Melodies in any key (major or minor) and any standard meter (simple or compound) comprised of diatonic pitches, rhythmic durations from bar length to subdivision length, with dotted and tied rhythms, and with mild syncopation. (Many students will carry this level over from Aural Skills II.)</p>

<p>Level 1: Melodies with characteristics of level 0, with chromatic passing tones and chromatic complete neighbor tones.</p>

<p>Level 2: Melodies with characteristics of level 1, with chromatic incomplete neighbor tones.</p>

<p>Level 3: Melodies with characteristics of level 2, with arpeggiations of applied chords and chromatic subdominant chords.</p>

<p>Level 4: Melodies with characteristics of level 3, that modulate to closely related keys.</p>

<h3 id='harmonic_listening'>Harmonic listening</h3>

<p>The objective for harmonic listening is for all students to listen to a phrase-long chord progression that includes chromatic chords and reliably dictate four elements—melody, bass line, functional bass, and thoroughbass figures.</p>

<p>Passages will be categorized according to the criteria listed below. Students must demonstrate the ability to dictate all four elements consistently, with minimal errors, on each level before moving to the next. The most advanced level in which a student has demonstrated proficiency will be the student&#8217;s grade for this category (i.e., proficiency in levels 0–3 by the deadline will result in a grade of 3).</p>

<p>Level 0: Passages containing only diatonic chords.</p>

<p>Level 1: Passages containing diatonic chords and chromatic subdominants.</p>

<p>Level 2: Passages containing diatonic chords, chromatic subdominants, and/or D7/x applied chords.</p>

<p>Level 3: Passages containing diatonic chords, chromatic subdominants, and D7/x and/or D4/x applied chords.</p>

<p>Level 4: Passages containing all types of diatonic, chromatic subdominant, and applied chords.</p>

<h3 id='writing_about_music'>Writing about music</h3>

<p>Generally, writing will be assessed according to following five criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify and write appropriately for a target audience.</li>

<li>Generate an original thesis based on evidence (that is, your analysis).</li>

<li>Construct clear linear argument in support of a thesis and devoid of unnecessary details.</li>

<li>Use musical terminology appropriately and effectively.</li>

<li>Demonstrate mastery of <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> for writing on music and citing sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each written work (there is one at the end of Unit I), you will receive a grade on the standard four-point scale equal to the number of these criteria you satisfy by the deadline, minus one. (I.e., fulfill all five and get a grade of 4; fulfill three and get a grade of 2; etc.)</p>

<p>There will be three written assignments during the semester. You will be allowed to reassess <em>one</em> of those papers after its deadline. At the end of the term, your median grade will be your final grade for this category.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions</strong>: If any of your papers at the end of the semester stand at a 0 or a 1, you cannot receive a final <em>writing about music</em> grade higher than a 2, no matter how solid your other papers are. Likewise, if any of your papers at the end of the semester stand at a 2, you cannot receive a final <em>writing about music</em> grade higher than a 3. (In other words, a final grade of 4 is reserved for those with three passing papers.)</p>

<h3 id='technology'>Technology</h3>

<p>Work in this category is on-going throughout the semester, so no grade will be given at the end of Unit I. However, students are expected to produce their reduction/analysis in music notation software. The accuracy and cleanness of that will be considered toward the final grade in this category.</p>
