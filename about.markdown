I'm 29 years old and I live and work in Naples, Italy. I'm a really curious person. I'm crazy about carrots. I have a nice [404](/404.html) page.

I love
------

- All well performed music
- Books
- Git
- Guitars and playing the guitar
- Linux (all flavours, especially *Ubuntu*)
- Photography
- Rails
- Ruby
- Vim

I love many other things too, but I wouldn't like to share them with the world.

I hate
------

- Dance music
- Internet Explorer
- Racism
- Timesheets
- Windows OS (all flavours, especially *all flavours*)

Surely there are a lot more things that I hate, but I don't want to share them with the world.
