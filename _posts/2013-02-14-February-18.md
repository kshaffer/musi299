Prepare thoroughbass reductions of both Schumann's and Brahms's settings of "Mondnacht." Under the reduction, provide both an interpreted functional-bass analysis, and a Roman-numeral analysis.

ENTRY TICKET: Bring both reductions/analyses to class. They do not need to be perfect, but they should be complete attempts, with specific written questions for any passages you are having trouble with.
