On Friday, we will focus on harmonic listening. Work this week toward passing off levels zero and one by spending a significant amount of out-of-class time working with Bass Generator.

ENTRY TICKET: Bring at least *five* dictation attempts that you have performed outside of class. Notate the bass line, figures, melody, and functional bass for each one, and write down the number of listenings it took to get it. (You can count two back-to-back listenings as one listening for the first time through.) Also, bring a printout, PDF, or notation file of the answer for each example for me to compare to your dictation. *At least two of the attempts you bring should be from level one.*

Also, bring whatever equipment (including staff paper) you need to perform dictation during class time.
