Spend some time playing through the keyboard schemata passed out today. Be intentional about comparing and contrasting progressions (not just single chords) of the same type. 

Bring staff paper to class Wednesday. We will spend time working on both harmonic and melodic listening.

Keep in mind that you *cannot* cram for the final dictation exam. If you are having any difficulty with any aspect of it, spend some time playing through the keyboard schemata, dictating progressions from BassGenerator, and/or transcribing melodies from the Karpinski text & CD.
