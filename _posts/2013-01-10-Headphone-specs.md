For those of you thinking about investing in a decent pair of headphones/earbuds for dictation and transcription work, here are the specs for my earbuds, which work quite well. They were less than $50, but are now discontinued. If you find something similar, it should work well for you. Try to purchase your headphones locally from a place with a friendly return policy, in case the first ones you try out don't cut it.

If the specs don't show up on the package in the store, look up the manufacturer part number in Google or at [B&H][bh]
