Listen to "Der Müller und der Bach" and "Des Baches Wiegenlied" from [*Die schöne Mullerin*][dsmScore] again, and spend some time thinking about the [text][dsmText]. Bring your scores and texts/translations to both of those songs to class.

There is no entry ticket.

Keep working on your harmonic listening. We will take a break from Lieder on Monday to work on/assess that. Plan on bringing your requisite equipment, and any dictations you have done recently (noting the number of listenings) to class on Monday.
