Look up some biographical information on Anton Webern. Don't all go to Wikipedia. Try Oxford Music Online (available from the CSU Library [music database page][musicData]) also.

If you need to revise and/or re-assess anything from Unit I, work on that now and try to get it done before Spring Break.
