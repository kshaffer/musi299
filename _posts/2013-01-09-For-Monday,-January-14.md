Continue working with the dictation program and practicing your sight-singing. Make it your goal to master level one for both categories by the end of the week. (One level per week for each category will get everyone to 4s by the end of Unit I.) Ambitious students, or those anticipating struggling with the analysis project, can aim for finishing level two by the end of the week.

For Monday, read Laitz, Chapter 17, "Harmonic Sequences." Ignore the section about composing sequences. Come to class prepared to spot these sequences in a thoroughbass reduction.

Bring the Laitz text to class.

ENTRY TICKET: Take the following examples from Laitz, re-notate the *bass notes* and *thoroughbass figures* on a staff, and replace Laitz's Roman numerals with functional bass symbols (preserve Laitz's harmonic-sequence notation): Examples 17.6, 17.8c, 17.10a, and 17.11. You can work on this with a partner, but each student should bring his/her own copy of this assignment. 

*If you come to class without this complete, you will be counted absent.* Exceptions will only be granted if a student contacts me ahead of time.
