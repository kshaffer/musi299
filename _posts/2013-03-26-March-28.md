Read the two chapter fragments from Robert Morgan's *Twentieth-Century Music* (in 299Shared): an excerpt from Chapter 9, "The Twelve-Tone System," and from Chapter 12, "Integral Serialism."

Bring your score to "Wie bin ich froh!" back to class again, and read through the tweets from Wednesday's class (below).

Come to class with any questions you have about the reading (especially Chapter 9) or the tweets, so we can address them and begin from a point of relative mutual understanding.
