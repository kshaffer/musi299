Read the two chapter fragments from Robert Morgan's *Twentieth-Century Music* (in 299Shared): an excerpt from Chapter 9, "The Twelve-Tone System," and from Chapter 12, "Integral Serialism."

Bring your score to "Wie bin ich froh!" back to class again, and read through the [tweets from Wednesday's class][storify].

Come to class with any questions you have about the reading (especially Chapter 9) or the tweets, so we can address them and begin from a point of relative mutual understanding.
