If you are comfortable, begin working with the dictation program. Try to master level zero, and if possible level one, by the end of the week. 

We will continue setup of the Bass Generator program in class, so please bring your laptop again.

If you are not ready to start working with the dictation program, start practicing Level 0 and Level 1 sight-singing melodies.
