Friday will be a dictation quiz. Bring staff paper, and if you are able, come to class early and play through some of the keyboard voice-leading patterns to prime them in your memory.

There is no assigned prep work other than to continue work choosing a piece for your final project, and prepare as appropriate for the dictation quiz.
