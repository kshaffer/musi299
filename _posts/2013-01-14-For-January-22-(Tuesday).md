## Performance ##

Each student will have a 6-minute slot in which to sing melodies from sight. You can choose to perform melodies at level zero, one, or two. (See the Unit I Rubric above for details and for corresponding chapters in the Karpinski *Manual* and *Anthology*.) You will only get one shot, so pick an appropriate level based on your practice thus far. In the remainder of class time, prepare for this assessment, or work individually on your dictation.

## Harmonic listening ##

You will also have an opportunity to pass off on your dictation work. Bring several dictations from the level you are currently on (both your hand-written dictation, and the correct answer given by my Bass Generator program). Then do a couple during Tuesday's class time to demonstrate that you can do it "live."

*Make it your goal to pass off at least level 1 in both of these categories on Tuesday.*
