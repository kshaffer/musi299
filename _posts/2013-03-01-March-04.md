In addition to working on your German Lieder project revision, revisit the fourth movement of Webern's *Fünf Sätze für Streichquartett*, Op. 5 (recording in 299Shared, scores distributed in class earlier in the week—there are a couple extras in the tray on my office door). 

Tweet at least one thing you see as a possible organizing principle or prominent motive/idea in the movement. It could be a recurring chord, melodic pattern, intervallic relationship, rhythmic pattern, succession of dynamics or tempos—anything that looks meaningful to the overall structure or coherence of the movement.

We will pick up our discussion of this piece during class, wherever you all leave off on Twitter.
