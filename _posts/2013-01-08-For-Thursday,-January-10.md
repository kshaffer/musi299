Continue working with the dictation program. Try to master level zero, and if possible level one, by the end of the week. 

We will work on singing and/or dictation in class. Please bring your laptop if you use it for Bass Generator, as well as the Karpinski *Anthology*. (The Karpinski *Manual* will be a helpful reference, but we won't use it as a class. Bring it if you think you may make reference to it.)

Also, be sure to bring staff paper to this, and all, class meetings.

Make it your goal to successfully assess two levels of work in sight-singing and/or harmonic listening by Friday. (That is, complete level zero in both categories, or level one in one category.)
