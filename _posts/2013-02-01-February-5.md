For Tuesday, watch the following video (which we will review in class):

This is, quite possibly, my favorite video of a musical performance ever. It's quite special. Enjoy!

We will sing and discuss this song, Schubert's "Der Erlkönig," in class. Find a score and a decent translation of the text online, and bring to class. (IMSLP and recmusic.org are good places to start.)

ENTRY TICKET: As we've been doing, write the solfège syllables above each note in the score, noting any modulations and chromatic alterations, and bring to class. As usual, you can work with a partner, as long as both contribute to the analysis.
