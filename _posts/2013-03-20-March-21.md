Watch the [video][vid] of my discussion of "Diminished Fifth." Come to class with any questions or further insights you have about the video or the piece itself. It's a big file, even though it's only 10 minutes and standard definition, so download it early if you can just to be safe.

Bring staff paper to class. We'll work on listening most of the class time, after discussing Bart√≥k.
