Review the [glossary of atonal terms][glossary], the resource on [Analyzing 12-tone music][twelveTone], and the [Analyzing atonal music][atonal] resource, as necessary. Come to class Thursday with written questions about these resources or Wednesday's class discussion on set classes.

Also, for Thursday, bring your scores to all the atonal and 12-tone pieces we have covered so far, in particular the Webern 5 Pieces for String Quartet, No. IV, and the Bartók "Diminished Fifth."

Lastly, we will be re-discussing the Ligeti article, "On Form in New Music" on Friday (sections I and II only). You may want to begin re-reading that now. Bring a copy of the article (in 299Shared) and your atonal/12-tone scores again on Friday.

Please DO NOT make annotations to the file in 299Shared. That ruins the file for the rest of the class. Print it out, or *copy and paste* it to another location on your computer and manipulate that file.
