During Wednesday's chapel service, consider the following questions:

- What is one idea expressed or thing done during chapel that you agree with and find profound or significant?  
- What is one idea expressed or thing done during chapel that you disagree with?  
- What is one question you have about something expressed or done during chapel? (something that confused you, something you want to know more about, etc.)

As you consider these questions, do one of the following:

- Tweet your ideas using #csuchapel and #musi199  
- Tweet your ideas only using #musi199  
- Write down your ideas and bring them to class on Thursday

(I totally understand that some won't be willing to share their views with the wider Twitterverse or CSU community, so I'm not requiring tweeting your responses. However, I do encourage those who are comfortable to participate in the public discourse, in order to grow in your abilities to do so and in order to model good social media use and public discourse for other students in the university. Everyone, though, should answer the questions and be prepared to discuss them in class on Thursday.)

After our discussion of these questions, we'll continue with the activity begun on Wednesday. Bring all of Wednesday's class materials with you on Thursday.
