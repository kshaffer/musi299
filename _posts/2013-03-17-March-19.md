Transcribe the following melodies from the Karpinski CD:

- Chapter 40, number 1  
- Chapter 41, number 2  
- Chapter 42, number 3  
- Chapter 43, number 4  

Try to get it as accurate as possible, and write down the number of listenings it took to get it right. (You can play it twice back-to-back at the beginning and count that as a single listening.)
