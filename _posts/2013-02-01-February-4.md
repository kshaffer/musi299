Bring your current progress on harmonic listening to class, as well as any equipment needed to do some dictation practice work. I will review your progress, monitor how you are going about the task, and offer assistance with the task. 

If you are ready to pass off on a level, bring evidence of a few correct transcriptions for that level (noting the number of listenings required to get it correct) along with the automatically generated score, and come prepared to do one or two live on that level while I am present.

My hope is that everyone can pass level zero or one on Monday. Please work this weekend toward that goal.

Please note that if you are working on level two, you need to download the new level two file, as well as replace BassGenerator.py with the updated version. Both are in 299Shared.
