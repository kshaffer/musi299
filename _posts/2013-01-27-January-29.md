Read Chapter 22 of the Laitz. Be sure to listen to the musical examples, or the text will make little sense, and you won't be able to draw on it for class activities this week. Also, pay special attention to Laitz's discussion of the songs from *Die schöne Mullerin* ("Die liebe Farbe" and "Die böse Farbe"). We will deal quite a bit with that song cycle this week.

Bring a printed copy of the text and translation to [*Die schöne Mullerin*][dsmText] to class, and a printout of [the score][dsmScore] for "Die liebe Farbe" and "Die böse Farbe".

Lastly, please review the draft course contract from Monday's class discussion, and come with any questions, additions, or corrections you think are needed before we make some sort of official commitment to it as a group.

We will return to Karpinski's discussion of modulation on Wednesday, so review (or read) Monday's assignment as necessary.
