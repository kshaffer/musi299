We will begin to apply what we've studied in Romantic English poetry to Romantic German poetry and art song. Review, if necessary, the resources on poetry:

- Jonathan Sircy's introduction to [Analyzing poetry][poetry].  
- Vanier College's [Poetry's Language][language].  
- Vanier College's [Poetry's Structure and Form][structure].  
- Brooklyn College's [Introduction to Romanticism][romanticism].

Also, bookmark the [LEO][LEO] online German dictionary.

If you have a pocket German dictionary, please bring it to class.

There is no entry ticket. However, consult [Friday's assignment post][Jan25] and get started on the entry ticket for Friday.
