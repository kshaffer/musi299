After reading Turabian, Chapter 6 "Planning a First Draft," compose a draft of your German Lied paper, or at least the body of your paper (no introduction or conclusion) along with your thesis statement. You will be reading and evaluating each other's drafts, and commenting on them in terms of both content and style.

ENTRY TICKET: Bring your draft and any supporting materials you need (scores, recordings, German dictionaries).

Also, bring your copy of the Turabian.
