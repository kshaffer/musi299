There is no homework for tomorrow. We will begin our (brief) exploration of 12-tone (dodecaphonic) compositional technique in class tomorrow. You don't want to miss it. Wednesday's activity will be the basis of Thursday's homework and in-class activity.

Take the opportunity to do some practice in melodic or harmonic dictation, whichever needs the most work, using the Karpinski CD or BassGenerator.
