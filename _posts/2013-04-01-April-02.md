In general this week, spend your out-of-class time preparing for Friday's listening assessment. Use the Karpinski CD and BassGenerator for that practice.

Also, for tomorrow, bring your score to "Ich bin wie froh!", as well as colored pens/pencils if you have them. (Don't run out and buy them if you don't, but if you have them, they will be handy.) This will, hopefully, be our last day with this song.
