THIS IS AN ENTRY TICKET ASSIGNMENT.

We will be working on listening/recognition in class, following off of the results of Friday's dictation assessment. The areas weakest on the assessment were melodies in minor and/or with chromatics (other than *fi*) and recognizing the melody in a harmonic texture. We'll focus on minor mode and chromatic melodies. In preparation, please transcribe the following melodies from the Karpinksi CD (clef, tonic, and bottom number are provided in the textbook at the end of the appropriate chapter):

- Chapter 53, no. 1  
- Chapter 53, no. 7  
- Chapter 55, no. 1  
- Chapter 55, no. 4

Note the number of listenings it took to get it correct, and whether or not you used the keyboard. Bring your dictations, and *lots* of blank staff paper, to class.
