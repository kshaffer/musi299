Spend some time practicing playing the keyboard voice-leading patterns, paying close attention to the difference in sound for each version of the same progression type. If you have trouble getting them fast enough to retain in working memory (4â€“6 seconds per progression), enter them into MuseScore/NoteFlight/Finale and listen to them back-to-back at the fastest tempo in which you can clearly hear the difference.

Bring staff paper to class. We will spend time focusing on listening.
