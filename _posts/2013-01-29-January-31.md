Read Karpinski, Chapters 69–70 on modulation to closely related keys.

Listen to "Der Müller und der Bach" and "Des Baches Wiegenlied" from [*Die schöne Mullerin*][dsmScore] and note any modulations.

Bring your scores to both of those songs, as well as "Die liebe Farbe" and "Die böse Farbe." We will practice singing them together.

ENTRY TICKET 1: Write down the closely related keys to A major, and to B-flat minor.

ENTRY TICKET 2: Write the solfège syllable above each note in the vocal parts for "Der Müller und der Bach." Be sure to take modulation and chromaticism into account. You may work with a partner if you like, but be sure that both contribute to the analysis.
