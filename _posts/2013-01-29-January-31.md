Read Karpinski, Chapters 69–70 on modulation to closely related keys.

Listen to "Der Müller und der Bach" and "Des Baches Wiegenlied" from [*Die schöne Mullerin*][dsmScore] and analyze them for modulations.

ENTRY TICKET 1: Write down the closely related keys to A major, and to B-flat minor.

ENTRY TICKET 2: Write the solfège syllable above each note in the vocal parts for "Der Müller und der Bach" and "Des Baches Wiegenlied." Be sure to take modulation and chromaticism into account. You may work with a partner if you like, but be sure that both contribute to the analysis.

After analyzing the modulations and scale degrees, practice singing each song through once, in solfège, while listening to the recording.
