Come to class prepared to discuss the following questions about the Helvetica documentary we watched on Tuesday:

- What was the motivation for the creation of Helvetica?  
- Why did the modernists love Helvetica so much?  
- What are one or two characteristics of the Helvetica typeface?  
- What does "Helvetica" mean?  
- Why have some designers/users come to react against Helvetica?  
- Why did some designers return to Helvetica after *grunge typography*?  
- If you are not a good designer, what typeface should you use?  
- Does Helvetica have a meaning in itself?  
- Will you ever look at a store or a street sign the same way again?

Continue to work on your paper draft and/or Thursday's reading.
