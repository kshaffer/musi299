There is no prep work for Thursday or Friday. Spend out-of-class time working on your analysis project or preparing for the dictation final.

Keep in mind the Turabian text you have in your possession. It has both clear instructions and examples for citation *and* short chapters that will help you with the process of analyzing and writing. I won't assign those, but please make use of them, especially if you have difficulty putting together your argument or your paper structure.

On Thursday and Friday we will discuss "special topics" related to professional musical life. Thursday will cover the business side of being a professional musician or private teacher: résumés, CVs, the difference between résumés and CVs, taxes, contracts, professional protocol, maintaining a private studio, seeking freelance work, etc. Friday will cover graduate school and "alternate" career paths (things other than performing, teaching, worship leading, and clinical work) that you can do with a music degree.

As I prepare for these days and field your questions, I'll put together posts on this website or the Resources website with links to helpful documents or articles related to these topics. Those will not be assigned reading, but will be helpful for some of you as you think about your professional life or graduate school.
