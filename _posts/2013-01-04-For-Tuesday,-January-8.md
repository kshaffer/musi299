Review the course syllabus, and email me with any questions you have about anything on it.

Review the topics and objectives for Unit I, and email me with any questions you have about it.

Purchase a headphone adapter, if you do not have one already. You need a 1/4" male stereo headphone jack to 1/8" female stereo headphone jack. (Something like [this][RS] or [this][CTG].)

Bring Karpinski *Anthology* to class on Tuesday, as well as your laptop if you have one that you will use for your harmonic listening work.
