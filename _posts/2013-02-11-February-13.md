Read and analyze the poem ["Mondnacht"][poem] by Josef Karl Benedikt von Eichendorff. In particular, think about and be prepared to discuss the following:

- What idea or emotion unifies the poemâ€™s different parts? (In other words, what is the poem about?)  
- What actions or beliefs does the poem support?  
- What examples of imagery do you find in the poem?  
- How would you set this poem to music? (tempo, volume, mode, meter, rhythmic characteristics, etc.)  
- Should this song be sung by a female or male vocalist? High, middle, low? What difference would it make to a listener's impression of the poem?
