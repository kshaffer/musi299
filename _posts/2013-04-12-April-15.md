ENTRY TICKET: If you have not sent me a piece for approval for your final project, do so this weekend. It must be *approved* before class on Monday (and I have a *very* busy weekend). Pieces covered in class are pre-approved, but you must tell me what your piece is before Monday's class via email.

Also, begin to plan out your analytical argument for your paper. Tuesday and Wednesday will be our individual meeting days.

Thursday and Friday will be our special topics days. Fill out [this survey][sm] to let me know what you'd most like to discuss.

Lastly, bring staff paper to class. We will spend the bulk of our time Monday on aural dictation.
