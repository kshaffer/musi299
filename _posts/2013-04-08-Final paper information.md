## Project ##

Analyze a short piece of music that is either *atonal* or *12-tone*, or which draws on aspects of both. It can be a piece covered in class, or a new piece.

The paper should be between 1000 and 2000 words (4â€“8 pages, double spaced in most 12-point fonts), it should include at least one embedded musical graphic, and you should follow the *Chicago Manual of Style, 16th ed.* for all style elements and citations. (Turabian 7th ed. follows the same style and citation guidelines.)

See the Unit II rubric for project objectives and assessment information. This analysis paper will cover the Unit II Analysis, Writing, and Technology criteria.

## Stages ##

Throughout the next couple weeks, I will assign readings from the Turabian to guide your planning and writing process. You will also be required to 1) get a piece approved by me and 2) meet with me individually to discuss your project in advance of your final submission. These will be entry ticket assignments. I also highly recommend that you schedule time with our Musicianship tutor, and/or a tutor in the Writing Center. Both will be incredibly helpful.

The first stage is to choose a piece for me to approve. The deadline for this *approval* is Monday, April 15. That means that if you plan on writing about a piece not discussed in class, you need to give me time to examine it, and you must have a backup ready. Any atonal or 12-tone piece covered in class is pre-approved (though some are easier than others to support a 1000+ word paper). If you want to write on a piece not covered in class, get on this right away. Approval will be the entry ticket for April 15th's class.
