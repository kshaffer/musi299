We will begin class with some live harmonic dictation practice. This will mainly be a check to see where you are in the process.

The rest of class will be devoted to practicing singing "Der Erlkönig." Get together with a partner not in your group this morning, and correct/finish your solfège analysis of the song. Bring your copies of the score to class.

There is no entry ticket, but you will need staff paper, and you will be lost without your analyzed "Erlkönig" score.
