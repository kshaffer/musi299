We will continue our analysis of the poem ["Mondnacht"][poem] by Josef Karl Benedikt von Eichendorff, looking at settings by Brahms and Schumann. These are the settings you will be analyzing for your Lieder paper. For Thursday, print off the score to each setting (both are in the 299Shared folder), analyze them for keys and modulations, and label the solfège syllable for each pitch in the appropriate key. You may work with a partner. You are also encouraged to listen to recordings of each song. A recording of the Schumann setting is in 299Shared. You can find the Brahms setting in the Naxos Music Library (access by going to the CSU Library database search, under the subject heading [music][nml], and go to Naxos from there) or other online sources. CSU may have a recording in the library CD collection as well.

ENTRY TICKET: Bring your printed scores with solfège syllables labeled.
