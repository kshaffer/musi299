Review (or read) Monday's readings from Karpinski on modulation.

We will practice singing on Wednesday, focusing on chromaticism and modulation. Bring your score for [*Die schöne Mullerin*][dsmScore], and practice singing "Die liebe Farbe" and "De böse Farbe" before class. (Recordings of DSM are in 299Shared on DropBox.)

ENTRY TICKET: On your printouts of "Die liebe Farbe" and "Die böse Farbe," write the solfège syllable above each note in the vocal part. Be sure to take modulation and chromaticism into account. You may work with a partner if you like, but be sure that both contribute to the analysis.

Also, bring the Karpinski *Manual* and *Anthology* in case you have questions about the reading and in case we have time to sing other excerpts besides the Schubert songs.
