Read the [glossary of atonal terms][glossary], which is still incomplete, but will provide you with some terms and tools for our subsequent analyses.

Review the resource on [Analyzing 12-tone music][twelveTone], as well as the additional information added to the [Analyzing atonal music][atonal] resource under "operations."

Also, for tomorrow, bring your score to "Ich bin wie froh!" We will discuss some of the interesting properties of its row.
