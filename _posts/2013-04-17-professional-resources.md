[The Upside of quitting][quit] – an episode of the Freakonomics podcast exploring when/why you should/shouldn't quit something. (Warning: it does include some "adult" topics. You are adults, but be judicious about what you believe to be appropriate. Most of the episode should be universally unobjectionable.)

[The Professor Is In][prof] – a great website by a former tenured research professor in the humanities, with helpful information about all of academic life, including graduate school and job searches.

[Don't Go? Leave? Stay?][lee] – an article on Inside Higher Ed by a fellow digital humanist on the current state of graduate school and professional life in the humanities. The first paragraph contains links to a number of recent article on the topic, on multiple sides of a current debate. Read those first.

[My academic CV][cv].

[My performance résumé][resume].
