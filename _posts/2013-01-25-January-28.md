Read Karpinski *Manual*, Chapters 67â€“68: "Reading in Keys Other than the Notated Key Signature" and "Introduction to Modulation." We will spend class time focusing on singing and modulation.

Also, begin to work on Tuesday's assignment, which will be posted soon, and which will contain an entry ticket.
