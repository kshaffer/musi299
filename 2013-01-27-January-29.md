Read Chapter 22 of the Laitz. Be sure to listen to the musical examples, or the text will make little sense, and you won't be able to draw on it for class activities this week. Also, pay special attention to Laitz's discussion of the songs from *Die schöne Mullerin* ("Die liebe Farbe" and "Die böse Farbe"). We will deal quite a bit with that song cycle this week.

Bring a printed copy of the text and translation to [*Die schöne Mullerin][dsmText] to class, and a printout of [the score][dsmScore] for "Die liebe Farbe" and "Die böse Farbe".

There will be no entry ticket, as I had originally planned. We will return to Karpinski's discussion of modulation on Wednesday, so review (or read) Monday's assignment as necessary.
